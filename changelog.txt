0.4.6.5 (02/04/2020):
-Added 'density' parameter tp scatter().
-Setting 'density'=True plots the colour of scatter points as their spatial number density to nearby points. This is done using a Gaussian kernel density estimate.
-Added scatter example (with 'density' usage) to Examples.ipynb

0.4.6.4 (19/03/2020):
-Replaced naming of parameters 'm' and 'c' in axline() with 'a' and 'b' to avoid conflict with colour parameter 'c' as per issue #38.

0.4.6.3 (19/03/2020):
-cornerplot() can now accepts a list of two for 'pair_type' which sets the plotting types for the lower and upper off-diagonal axes.
-'pair_kw' is now deprecated and has been replaced by explicitly 'contour_kw', 'scatter_kw' and 'hist2D_kw'.
-Fixed bug in cornerplot() where labels would not be correctly assigned automatically if more than one group given.
-cornerplot() now correctly shares the x/y axes of subplots according to their columns/rows without linking 1D histogram axes on the diagonal.

0.4.6.2 (18/03/2020):
-Added minimum number of elements per bin to plots_1d.hist(), same functionality as nmin in plots_2d.hist2D().

0.4.6.1 (10/03/2020):
-Fixed bug in plots_1d.hist() with binned statistics not working for list of data.
-Switched plots_2d.contourp() to use matplotlib's colourbar instead of our own.

0.4.6.0 (20/02/2020):
- Made modifications and bugfixes to splt.contourp(), including:
 * Added the 'labels' parameter for labelling contour lines.
 * Added the 'smooth' parameter to apply a Gaussian smoothing kernel to the contours. 'smooth' is the sigma of the kernel.
 * Renamed parameter clabel --> labels
 * Renamed parameter 's' --> linestyle. 's' was ambiguous and could be confused with the 's' used in scatter for "size".
 * Added alliases for linestyle: 'ls' or 's' and for c: 'color'.
 * Fixed problem where 'clabel' applied to contour labels, rather than to colorbar as documentation stated
 * 'clabel' now controls colorbar label and 'labels' controls the labels for the contours.
 * Fixed bug where percent, bin_type, bins, s (linstyle) would only accept lists and not other iterables
 * Fixed bug where if the length of s (linestyle) was < 4, code would force linestyle='solid'.
 * Fixed bug when clabel[0] == None no legend would be plot in the case where other items in clabel were not None.
 * Fixed bug where if no ax was given and a call was made directly to ax, it would crash.
 * Adjusted handling of 'color' to accept: strings, floats, arrays. If color is number, now correctly samples the cmap at the correct percent value.
 * Adjusted usage of labels. If labels=True, automatically generate labels from 'percent'. If labels is string, display only one label in legend. If labels is an array-like, each element applies to an individual contour line. If labels = False or None, do not display a legend.
 * Adjusted retrieval of next colour in cycler to use: "next(ax._get_lines.prop_cycler)['color']" instead of plotting a temporary line.
 * Added feature where if length of 'linestyle' or 'color' were less than paercent, they would be cycled until forming a list of corrent length.
 * Added feature where colorbar is plot if clabel given.
 * Removed displaying of labels as a default behaiviour.
 * Removed automatic setting of 'linestyle' to 'solid' if col was not string.
 * Removed multiple calls to "output = Params. ...".
 * Removed "if None in (percent, cmap, clim, s, ...)" as this conflicted with numpy arrays.
 * Removed 'viridis' default from 'cmap' docstring.
